# noDEWORKS
Dynamic, Interactive, node edges builder. Network Graphing tool. 

### Inspiration
This was inspired by my SPUR project from summer 2024. Where we were making social networks of Industries and different researchers in Maynooth.  

### Background
I had used igraph and visnetwork before. I thought that it would be interesting to add some sort of interactive element, where you can make connections and nodes.  

### Name
Owen O'Connor and I came up with the name on a Friday evening.

### Improvements
I had a function for load your own data - it would crash and load up the non existent files from some temporary data.
